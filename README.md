# A Non-Linear Exploration of Non-Linear Narratives

This is a website of notes I created to keep track of my thoughts while I was researching non-linear electronic books as part of my master's thesis. Originally written as posts in a blog, I've since translated them into this website using [Twine](http://twinery.org/). I hope it helps you find something interesting to read.

The site is live at http://silentfuzzle.github.io/Non-Linear-Exploration/

You can read more about my research [here](https://gatesmediablog.wordpress.com/adventurous-reader/).
