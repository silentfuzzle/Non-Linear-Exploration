# A Non-Linear Exploration of Non-Linear Narratives

This is a website of notes I created to keep track of my thoughts while I was researching non-linear electronic books as part of my master's thesis. Originally written as posts in a blog, I've since translated them to this website using Twine. I hope it helps you find something interesting to read.

This site is live at http://silentfuzzle.github.io/Non-Linear-Exploration/
